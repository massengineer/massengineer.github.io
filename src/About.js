      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        I'm a self-taught web developer, passionate about building projects that
        solve real-world problems. I started coding in December 2024 and have
        since been learning new technologies, focusing on JavaScript, Node.js,
        Express.js, and MongoDB for backend development. For ML projects, I am
        familiarising myself with Python's capabilities.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        When I'm not coding, I'm diving into STEM-related podcasts, learning
        foreign languages, solving puzzles, tinkering with arduinos or following
        online ethical hacking courses. I love challenges and I always strive to
        expand my skillset. I am currently reading Mechatronic & Robotic
        Engineering at the The University of Birmingham and working on a fitness
        start-up, SyncMove, with my good friend. This opportunity allowed me to
        finally break into the world of programming. I am still early in my
        programming journey but I am learning rapidly by asking key questions.
